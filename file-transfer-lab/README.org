#+TITLE: File Trasfer Lab
#+AUTHOR: Sergio Yanez
#+DATE:  10/01/2018
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil
#+STARTUP: inlineimages
* Description
  The lab include the code for a single server and user to interact with each other by sending and recibin  generic files 
* Usage
 you must run the code as:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
 python fileServer.py
#+END_SRC 
you must run start the proxy with:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
 python ../stammer-proxy/stammerProxy.py
#+END_SRC 
 followed by :
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
 python file client.py
#+END_SRC
When a client starts, the program prompts for the type of connection you want to have with the serveri(directly or by a proxy). Use *Y* to connect directly to the server and *N*  to use the default proxy. To utilize the client the user can either enter /put/get/ <file-name> to interact with the corrsponding file.
* Files
** /server
   - folder simulating the data stored inside a server.Used for testing purposes.
*** igigS.txt
    - text file that contains a gig(supposely) of numbers.
*** servertest.txt
    - file used to check if data is being send to the  client correctly.
** fileClient.py
   - file which contains the code of the client
** fileServer.py
   - file which contains the code for the server
** filemaker.py
   - program that makes two files full of numbers  one 1 megabyte 
   and 1 gigbyte 
** fileSock.py
   - program that stored the methods to send and recieve meseges.
** imegU.txt
   - file containgin 1 meg of random numbers

* DONE Thrusday [3/3]
  - [X] implement multiple clients.
    - maybe useing a list of clients and iterating though them.
  - [X] using fork to run simultanious processes.
  - [X] all edge cases with no files, existing files and empty commands.
